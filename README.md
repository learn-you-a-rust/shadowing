# shadowing
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html

Shadowing uses the key word `let` to perform certain allowable transformations on a value. 
A variable does not need to be specified as mutable to allow shadowing.

The `let` key word creates a new variable each time, so you can change the type of a variable with a `let` statement. With `mut`, by contrast, you can change the value but not the type of the variable.
